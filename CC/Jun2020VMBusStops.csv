The recent conversion of ridership tracking hardware has created significant error in ridership attribution for certain routes. Jurisdictional attribution may not be reliable for all  routes for that reason. Recent COVID 19 related ridership declines have resulted in a temporary hiatus in marking potentially erroneous data based on year over year ridership changes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
